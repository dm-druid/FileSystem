Frankly speaking, it is a little ugly.

This project only simulates the file system's management and operations which  aims to help students have a basic comprehension to the concepts of file system like: the multi-index stucture of restoring a file or the bitmap of the space in disk. Atually it can't be defined as a file system strictly. It would be more suitable to call it as sinple course homework.
